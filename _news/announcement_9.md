I had the privilege to give a talk on '*Building multimodal datasets for African languages*' at this year's [AfricaNLP 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/africanlp2024/home) edition that was co-located at [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc) conference. Check the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1roRmmmcv3E4cUkyv2nhBk0FFmX2Jwc57_4rP5yfmBv4/edit?usp=sharing)!
